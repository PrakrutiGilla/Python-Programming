#Generator Comprehension

#Generator Comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions. One difference between them is that generator comprehensions
#use circular brackets.The major difference between them is that generators donâ€™t allocate memory for the whole list.
#Instead, they generate each value one by one which is why they are memory efficient. 

"""input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7]

print("Output values using generator comprehensions:", end = ' ') 
  
for var in output_gen: 
    print(var, end = ' ')

    
Output:

Output values using generator comprehensions: 2 4 4 6 """
